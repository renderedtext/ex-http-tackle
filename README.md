## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add http_tackle to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:http_tackle, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure http_tackle is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:http_tackle]]
        end
